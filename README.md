# Machine Learning Engineer Interview Questions

This repo stores various questions and notebooks to help interview Machine Learning Engineers.
Feel free to contribute to it to add/extend on the list of questions.

We will cover different areas of the MLE job since it spans across multiple job families: SW Engineer, Data Analyst, Data Scientist, DevOps Engineer.
- The first really has to do with the **algorithms and theory** behind machine learning. You’ll have to show an understanding of how algorithms compare with one another and how to measure their efficacy and accuracy in the right way.
- The second category has to do with your **programming skills** and your ability to execute on top of those algorithms and the theory.
- The third has to do with your **general interest in machine learning**. You’ll be asked about what’s going on in the industry and how you keep up with the latest machine learning trends.
- Finally, there are **company or industry-specific questions** that test your ability to take your general machine learning knowledge and turn it into actionable points to drive the bottom line forward.
