# Programming


#### 1. Do you have experience with Spark or big data tools for machine learning?
 - You’ll want to get familiar with the meaning of big data for different companies and the different tools they’ll want. Spark is the big data tool most in demand now, able to handle immense datasets with speed. Be honest if you don’t have experience with the tools demanded, but also take a look at job descriptions and see what tools pop up: you’ll want to invest in familiarizing yourself with them.

#### 2. What are some differences between a linked list and an array?
 - An **array** is an ordered collection of objects.
 - A **linked list** is a series of objects with pointers that direct how to process them sequentially.
 - An array assumes that every element has the same size, unlike the linked list.
 - A linked list can more easily grow organically: an array has to be pre-defined or re-defined for organic growth. Shuffling a linked list involves changing which points direct where—meanwhile, shuffling an array is more complex and takes more memory.

#### 3. Describe a hash table.
 - A hash table is a data structure that produces an associative array. A key is mapped to certain values through the use of a hash function. They are often used for tasks such as database indexing.

#### 4. Which data visualization libraries do you use? What are your thoughts on the best data visualization tools?
 - What’s important here is to define your views on how to properly visualize data and your personal preferences when it comes to tools. Popular tools include R’s ggplot, Python’s seaborn and matplotlib, and tools such as Plot.ly and Tableau.

#### 5. How are primary and foreign keys related in SQL?
 - Most machine learning engineers are going to have to be conversant with a lot of different data formats. SQL is still one of the key ones used. Your ability to understand how to manipulate SQL databases will be something you’ll most likely need to demonstrate. In this example, you can talk about how foreign keys allow you to match up and join tables together on the primary key of the corresponding table—but just as useful is to talk through how you would think about setting up SQL tables and querying them.

#### 6. How would you build a data pipeline?
 - Data pipelines are the bread and butter of machine learning engineers, who take data science models and find ways to automate and scale them. Make sure you’re familiar with the tools to build data pipelines (such as Apache Airflow) and the platforms where you can host models and pipelines (such as Google Cloud or AWS or Azure). Explain the steps required in a functioning data pipeline and talk through your actual experience building and scaling them in production.

#### 7. What are the key features of Python?
 - Python is one of the most popular programming languages used by data scientists and AIML professionals. This popularity is due to the following key features of Python:
 - Python is easy to learn due to its clear syntax and readability
 - Python is easy to interpret, making debugging easy
 - Python is free and Open-source
 - It can be used across different languages
 - It is an object-oriented language which supports concepts of classes
 - It can be easily integrated with other languages like C++, Java and more
