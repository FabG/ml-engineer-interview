# Company Industry Knowledge


#### 1. What do you think is the most valuable data in our business?
- This question or questions like it really try to test you on two dimensions. The first is your knowledge of the business and the industry itself, as well as your understanding of the business model. The second is whether you can pick how correlated data is to business outcomes in general, and then how you apply that thinking to your context about the company. You’ll want to research the business model and ask good questions to your recruiter—and start thinking about what business problems they probably want to solve most with their data.

#### 2. Who do you follow in the ML/Data Science community? What are the last machine learning papers you’ve read?
 - Keeping up with the latest scientific literature on machine learning is a must if you want to demonstrate an interest in a machine learning position.

#### 3. Do you have research experience in machine learning?
 - Related to the last point, most organizations hiring for machine learning positions will look for your formal experience in the field. Research papers, co-authored or supervised by leaders in the field, can make the difference between you being hired and not. Make sure you have a summary of your research experience and papers ready—and an explanation for your background and lack of formal research experience if you don’t.
